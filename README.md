# LEOPARD <img src="figures/leopard.png" alt="" width="28" height="28">: A Vision Language Model for Text-Rich Multi-Image Tasks
<center><img src="figures/intro.png" alt="Auto-Instruct Illustration" width="" height=""></center>

This is the repository for Leopard, a MLLM that is specifically designed to handle complex vision-language tasks involving multiple text-rich images. In real-world applications, such as presentation slides, scanned documents, and webpage snapshots, understanding the inter-relationships and logical flow across multiple images is crucial.

The code, data, and model checkpoints will be released in one month. Stay tuned!
